\section{Examples} \label{examples}

In the directory TEST\_DATA/ there are three example datasets, a gnuplot file to plot the comparison between input data and function fit data along with a script to run Vfit and plot the comparison for a given model order and number of iterations.

The script to run the examples is run as follows:

run\_Vfit filename model\_order max\_iternations

Examples:

1. Data from the impedance of a 'realistic' capacitor model consisting of a 
R L C series combination, R=85 mohms, L=43nH, C=1uF

run\_Vfit CAPACITOR\_CJS\_Z.CSV 1 2

2. Measured impedance data for port 1 of a band pass filter with short circuit port 2.

run\_Vfit BPF\_SHORT\_Z.CSV 12 4
