Project to implement vector fitting software in FORTRAN.

Contents:

SRC: source files and Makefile

bin: executable file

TEST_DATA: A script (run_Vfit) to run the software and plot results

DOCUMENTATION: pdf documentation and the LaTeX files to produce it

Prerequisites:
The software requires a Fortran compiler to make e.g. gnufortran.

The script run_Vfit uses gnuplot to plot results.
