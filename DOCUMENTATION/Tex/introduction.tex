\section{Section}\label{introduction}

The vector fitting process introduced by Gustavsen and Semlyen \cite{vfit1} is a method for fitting rational function approximations to complex frequency domain transfer functions.
This project provides an implementation of the vector fitting process. Ths software is written in Fortran and includes a Makefile to allow the software to be compiled under unix. Windows users may install Cygwin (which is effectively a unix type environment) and then compile the software under cygwin. 

In addition to the software some simple examples are provided along with a script which may be used to run the examples and plot the results.

\subsection{Document outline}


Section \ref{vector_fit} describes the theory which underlies the vector fitting process for developing pole-zero model fits to complex s-domain transfer funtion data.

Section \ref{software} describes the software which implements the vector fitting process along with the input and output data formats.

Section \ref{examples} describes some examples of running the software.
